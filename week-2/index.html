## Week 2 - Brainstorming

Monday - Our table had a number of ideas for generating energy:
    * Using a heat or pressure gradient in air to drive some kind of mechanism to generate power
    * Compost; as it decomposes, compost releases energy, and so it would be a good idea to use that to generate a heat gradient
    * Lenses; using lenses to magnify the energy of the sun into a certain spot
    * Springs/Platforms; Having platforms that can compress from weight, such as people on sidewalks, pushing down springs or another mechanism
