## Week 3 - Refining ideas

We've split up into teams according to the stage of energy in our project:
<ul>
    <li>Collection</li>
    <li>Storage</li>
    <li>Usage</li>
</ul>
With this, our table of energy collection began to elaborate on previously brought up methods of energy collection, along with considering their efficiency.
This involved calculating the amount of energy that could be produced by an area of 2 meters squared, each. Some performed much better than others:
<ul>
    <li>Rainwater turned out to be quite inefficient. Having a collector with a depth of 10 feet, using data from Boston-Logan Airport,
        and calculating potential energy, rain had an energy of about 42 mW. Considering how much more energy could be generate using that water,
        rainwater had a total of ~100 mW. It is also somewhat rare for it to rain sometimes.</li>
    <li>On the other hand, wind energy was much more efficient, having an efficiency of 27.4 W per square meter. Boston is a good location for this, but maybe
        not every other location may be as fortunate.</li>
    <li>Human-powered energy from footsteps is only marginally better, having a value of 28.2 W in a given square meter, assuming 10 people per minute. This could be maximized
        in a busy location in a city, scaling well with human-congested areas.</li>
    <li>Solar was, by far, the most efficient of the power sources immediately thought of. On a sunny day, it could produce around 1.28 kW per square meter.
        Sun, however, is not guaranteed to shine all the time, or all day, which is the biggest downside</li>

</ul>
